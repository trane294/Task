## Synopsis

This project was made for a task.


## Installation

To see example you need to use folder `public` under any virtual host (example Apache).

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName task.dev
        DocumentRoot "/Users/user/task/public"
    </VirtualHost>`


## Tests

Testes are not provided in this example. I am familiar with React `TestUtils` but don't have big experience with it.

## Addition

Error example provided on `Home` and `SignIn` pages. Didn't implement global error component.

Sorry for a messy commit log. Task was done from different machines and could not provide full steps of my work.
